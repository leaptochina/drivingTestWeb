    Park your vehicle as far to the left-hand side of the road as possible
    Turn on hazard lights
    If it`s dark, raining or foggy, turn on your vehicle’s parking lights
    If it’s safer to remain in the vehicle, ensure all occupants sit in seats as far from traffic as they can and fasten their seatbelts
    If you feel it`s safer for you and your passengers outside of the vehicle, ensure you:
    leave the vehicle from the passenger side away from traffic (usually the passenger door)
    take all passengers with you
    find a safe area away from the road or behind a roadside barrier
    If your life is at immediate risk call 111; if there is danger but not life threatening, call *555 to inform Police
    AA Members can call *222 from their mobile phone for AA Roadservice assistance, log a callout on the AA Roadservice app, or use an emergency roadside phone if available
    Wait for AA Roadservice; do not attempt to fix the vehicle yourself
    Do not approach the AA Roadservice vehicle when it arrives – stay in your vehicle or in the safe area you have moved to and wait for the service officer to approach you

    You must be able to see behind the towed trailer or vehicle. If you can`t see behind with your rear-view mirrors, you may need to fit a special mirror.
    There must be no more than 4 metres between your vehicle and the trailer or vehicle it is towing.
    The maximum speed for a light vehicle towing a trailer on the open road is 90 km/h.
    The maximum speed for towing a motorcycle is 30 km/h.
    You must not tow a motorcycle unless it is mechanically disabled.
    At night, the back of the trailer/towed vehicle must show a red light.
    If you`re towing a disabled vehicle at night, its headlights must light up the towing connection.
    Remember, you will be slower and less stable than other traffic when towing. Check behind often to see if other vehicles are held up behind you.
    If the road is winding or narrow and vehicles can`t pass you, stop at a safe place and let them pass.
    Leave more space than usual between your vehicle and the one in front, so that others can pass you.
    Remember that the added weight behind you means you will need more space to stop.
    Increase your following distance from two seconds to four seconds.
